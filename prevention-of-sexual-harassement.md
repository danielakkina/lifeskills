# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

### 1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?
Sexual harassment often includes, but is not limited to, the following behaviors:
- **Inappropriate comments**: This includes sexual remarks, jokes, or innuendos that make others uncomfortable.
- **Unwanted gestures**: Such as staring, whistling, or leering that makes someone feel uncomfortable.
- **Physical advances**: Unwanted physical contact, including touching, patting, or close physical proximity without consent.
- **Non-verbal actions**: Sending sexually suggestive content, including emails, texts, or messages with sexual undertones.
- **Persistent advances**: Repeatedly asking someone on dates or making romantic propositions despite rejection.

### 2. What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?
- **Report the incident**: Inform the appropriate Human Resources representative or designated contact in the organization.
- **Support the affected individual**: If witnessing harassment, support the victim and encourage them to speak up.
- **Document the incidents**: Keep a record of dates, times, locations, and people involved if experiencing repeated harassment.
- **Use company resources**: Many organizations provide resources, such as an Employee Assistance Program (EAP), to help individuals cope with harassment.
- **Understand policies and procedures**: Familiarize yourself with the companyâ€™s anti-harassment policy and reporting channels to ensure a prompt response.
